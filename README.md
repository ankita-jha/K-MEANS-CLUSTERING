This project provides a visualization of the K-means clustering algorithm using JavaScript. It dynamically generates initial cluster centers and visualizes data points along with these centers on a chart. Each cluster center and data point is represented with distinct colors and shapes for easy differentiation. The project utilizes a customizable JavaScript function to simulate patient data in a hypothetical scenario, plotting them based on two parameters: WGB (Weighted Green Bias) and RGB (Red-Green Bias) levels.
